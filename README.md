# General information

Numerical models have been applied in many fields, and it is more important to apply them to solve the coastal hydraulic problem thank to the rapid development of computing technology. The numerical technique can be based on the finite element method, finite difference method, boundary element method, finite volume method and Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The time-stepping algorithm can be implicit, semi-implicit, explicit, or characteristic-based. The shape function can be of the first order, second-order, or higher order. The modelling can be simplified into different spatial dimensions, i.e., a one-dimensional (1D) model, two-dimensional (2D) depth-integrated model, 2D lateral-integrated model, 2D layered model and 3D model [(Coastal Wiki)](http://www.coastalwiki.org/wiki/Modelling_coastal_hydrodynamics).<br><br>

The [SWASH model](https://swash.sourceforge.io/) (an acronym of Simulating WAves till SHore) is a non-hydrostatic wave-flow model and is intended to be used for predicting the transformation of dispersive surface waves from offshore to the beach for studying the surf zone and swash zone dynamics, wave propagation and agitation in ports and harbours, rapidly varied shallow water flows typically found in coastal flooding resulting from e.g. dike breaks, tsunamis and flood waves, density-driven flows in coastal waters, and large-scale ocean circulation, tides and storm surges. Many studies have applied this model to solve a coastal problem, including the near zone, sediment transport, and vegetation interaction.
